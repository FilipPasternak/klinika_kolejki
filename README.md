# Queue Simulation App (Skeleton)

Desktop-oriented queue simulation for a clinic (M/M/c), ready for PyQt6 GUI integration.
This repository currently contains a working core simulation engine (no GUI yet).

## Stack
- Python 3.10+
- SimPy (reserved for later; current engine is custom step-by-step loop)
- PyQt6 (GUI skeleton stubs provided; not yet wired)
- pyqtgraph (for live plots; placeholder)
- numpy

## Run a quick simulation (headless)
```bash
python quick_test.py
```
